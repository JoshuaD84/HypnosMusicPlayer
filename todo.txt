Before Next Release
	All
		Exporting playlist as folder freezes UI. 
				
		Drag and drop from title of current song to places
		
		Right click menu settings for playlists -- shuffle, repeat, etc. 
		
		Play mounted audio cd
		
		Escape after hitting ctrl + 1 -> make it do something
		
		Show in tag edit window when a file doesn't support a particular tag type

		Missing tracks are deleted from currentlist after restart if CurrentList.mode == ALBUM instead of remaining and being highlighted in red
		
		Make a collection of test files. 
		
	Windows
		Select Multiple Files in explorer - No Option to play in Hypnos. Add that
		
		Hotkey with win + x released causees start menu to show
		
		EXE Wrapper doesn't behave well with pinning.  Try changing icon in javaw.exe	

		Open with causes the current track button to not show the current track's name. 
		
		Windows 7 - Songs with strange characters display as noise -- Neon Genesis Evangelion











Future		
	Windows 
		Send a file via command line when hypnos isn't playing -- it starts
		Then do it again with hypnos playing, it doesn't start playing the new track, just puts it on curernt list	
	
	Drag and Drop to Playlist Info update current list if it is that playlist unchanged
	
	Windows - First hover over the love button makes it shift positions
		Launch Hypnos without lastfm widgets showing
		turn on last fm widgets
		hover over love button -- it shifts
		If you launch with lastfm showing, doesn't happen
	
	Improve library checker
		Log / status
		some controls, maybe
		use the diskTimeStamp variables I added
		
	AppImage - Combine the two scripts that are currently being used to launch hypnos and make them one
		
	File name in tag window somewhere
		I tried doing what I have on the album track list window. It looked ugly and cluttered. 

	KDE Neon
		Can't drag ad drop an mp3 into hypnos
			onDragOver doesn't seem to hear the drag event. 
		
		User said it opened the track instead of opening folder. Confirmed on KDE Neon image on my computer, it opened gwenview 
			https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48131760/desktop-getdesktop-open-folder-in-kde-opens-up-gwenview-instead-of-dolphin
			
	I emptied the current list and library and playing track, and the art stayed. probably good to get rid of that
	
	Add a place to drag and drop folders (or navigate to them) to demand that they be rescanned immediately.
			
	Drag and drop from misc places to system
		playlist table -> m3u
		track table, history, queue, info windows, current table -> copy single tracks
		album table -> folder

	Redo global hotkeys, do it on a system-by-system type basis.
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79658/react-on-global-hotkey-in-a-java-program-on-windows-linux-mac
		Some Global Hotkeys aren't consumed - Win + C, Win + X, etc.  
			
		Windows:
			jkeymaster - windows + x keys not supported
			
			JHotKeys - I can't find a jar, and having trouble building one. 
		
			JNativeHook: Hotkey consumption for win keys is bad -- if you press win + v it works, but if you release the win button first, stuff breaks badly 
				
		Linux
			http://sourceforge.net/projects/jxgrabkey/
			
			JNativeHook - No consumption of hotkey
	
	Tag auto fix button
		
	Maybe add sorting of roman numerals? 
		https://gist.github.com/julienhaversano/9197588
	
	If something gets dropped into config/playlists folders, update the UI to include it? 
	
	Playlist throttled filter, but who's going to have over 1000 playlists? 


:::: Java / JavaFX stuff ::::

		
	Don't allow tag table columns to be reordered
		8/12/2018 - Currently not supported by java 8 / javafx8
		
	Scroll speed on lyrics scroll pane when the lyrics almost-but-dont-quite fit one full screen is really slow. 
   
	Try to fit all data in current list table by adjusting columns that aren't no-resize on setCurrentList, if not possible, do nothing
		I did some work on this. It conflicts with our FormattedAlbumCell because there, to keep it from wrapping
		we setminwidth to double.max, causing the fit function to fail. 
		I used the reflection stuff from this thread, and I think it would've worked if not for this issue:
			https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23284437/javafx-tablecolumn-resize-to-fit-cell-content
		Of course, I would have to then check table width, fail gracefully and revert, or distribute excess space. 
		
	Resize Policy
		Windowed mode, shrink window until a scrollbar appears. Maximize window so scrollbar disappears -- Scrollbar width is still accounted for
		
		Scrollbar width is calculated wrong by 4 pixels. I have it hardcoded, but I posted a SE question
			https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47852175/get-full-width-of-scrollbar-for-a-tableview
					
	Double clicking on table-column dividers doesn't call resize:
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47852239/customresizepolicy-not-triggering-when-a-columns-headers-divider-is-double-cli
			
	Tray Icon
		I have a few demos that are all terrible. It looks like we need to wait for JavaFX to get this going for us. 
		Or maybe just show an icon with no menus. Kinda hate that. How do we exit? 
		Gnome 3 doesn't support. Code works but creates a bad entry on taskbar.
		What systems do support? 
		What other systems don't support? How to handle? 
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29995727/java-systemtray-icon-does-not-always-work
	
	Tiny drop shadow on transport buttons when in dark theme. It's the line HBox, VBox, #transport { ... -fx-background-color: #222222 ... }
	
	Showing any dialog prevents window drag resize in ubuntu / other linux
		http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8140491
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33134791/javafx-stage-cant-be-resized-after-showing-a-dialog
	
	While loading the library, the table view scrolls a little bit. 
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47950917/stop-tableview-small-scroll-when-adding-content-to-bottom-of-table
		1/2/18 - Bug submitted to bugs.java.com
		
	Inconsistent KeyEvent consumption - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48054928/inconsistent-keyevent-consumption-by-textfield
		Resolved in java 9 apparently
	
	Java 9
		Using java 9 to launch hypnos crashes. I can't get either OpenSDK or OracleSDK to run, for different reasons
		
		Also:
			WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
			WARNING: Illegal reflective access by net.joshuad.hypnos.Hypnos (file:/home/joshua/workbench/hypnos-9-test/hypnos.jar) to field java.lang.ClassLoader.sys_paths
			WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of net.joshuad.hypnos.Hypnos
			WARNING: Use --illegal-access=warn to enable warnings of further illegal reflective access operations
			WARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release
			

:::: Refactor / organize my code ::::

 	Make LibraryUpdater part of Library. Is there a way to abstract out the Platform -> RunLater part? I feel like we're just stuck w/ that, which kind of ties to us JavaFX. 
 		Maybe ui.runMe ( Runnable ), and then the UI can decide whether to launch a new thread, have a thread idling, do it on this thread, or use something like Platform.runLater()	
		
	a better structure for hotkey commands (maybe combine with commandline commands?)
	
			
	Refactor Library
		Make a source directory a class, not just a path.
			Library Source Directories - highlight in red if they are missing. 

		An album will form from tracks if you edit them and they aren't currently an album. But an album won't split if you edit tags and make it not be an album.
			Is this desired behavior? I feel like probably no -- it can create different states based on the same disk contents, which doesn't make sense
					
		Sometimes there are duplicated tracks in the track list
		
		When removing all sources, it takes a long time to remove everything (5+ seconds)
			This is because of the processWatcherEvents function taking lots of time on load. 
			
		Setup a currentList.updateAlbum and updatePlaylist system
			Doesn't change artwork
			CurrentplayingTrack is the same one
			updates data and locations
			
		Library load and unload time
		
		Loader status % complete thing
		
		Allow sources to be hidden
		
		Maybe allow a filter for file type and lossy vs not lossy
			Maybe just a special search text "type:mp3", "type:lossy"
			I dunno making search box script is alot. 
		
		Give user feedback about the disk scanner and the ability to control it	

:::: OS Specific ::::

	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17305524/simplicity-for-executing-java-from-c
	
	Windows
		NSIS
			Version number dynamically assigned
			
			Open-with shell integration
				http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Add_your_app_in_each_EXE_in_the_context_menu
				
				This is pretty close. It makes an entry but it doesn't work. Could be a lot of different problems.
				WriteRegStr HKCR ".flac\shell\Hypnos\command" "" "$INSTDIR\Hypnos.exe $\"%1$\""
				
		When you launch show busy mouse cursor
