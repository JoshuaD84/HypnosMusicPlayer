TODO
	Library	
		I don't know if albums will form from tracks after they have loaded and been identified as not an album, then id3 tags edited.
	
		Sigur Ros () doesn't load.
		
		Albums aren't updating on the album list when you edit tags. Probably because they're behind in the update queue or I broke album.update
		
		Sometimes there are duplicated tracks in the track list
		
		When removing all sources, it takes a long time to remove everything (5+ seconds)
			This is because of the processWatcherEvents function taking lots of time on load. 
			
		Setup a currentList.updateAlbum and updatePlaylist system
			Doesn't change artwork
			CurrentplayingTrack is the same one
			updates data and locations
			
		Library load and unload time
	
	Playback Engine
		Maybe don't start the player thread until the very end. It's starting kinda early and looping. May be delaying start up time
		
		Program occasionally locks in decoders.closeAllResources() -> audioOutput.close(). 
			Information gathered:
				audioOutput.stop() could cause the problem, but was an unnecessary call, so I removed it. 
					Will this cause problems when I have a pool? Won't I have to call stop on the lines
					
				Guaranteeing that 2 or 5 frames play through the line before closing reduces the problem significantly
				but I was still able to generate a freeze by going crazy on the UI
				
				There were other bugs in my loop thread with stopRequested and state causing similar freezes, but I fixed those.
				
				If I cause a stop in one program and then launch another completely separate program, it also locks, but in a different place
					I didn't confirm 100%, but I'm pretty sure it's at Decoder.openStreamsAt() -> audioOutput.open()
					
				I should be able to write a pretty simple proof of bug. Putting anything else aside, I should do that and post it around.
					AudioFormat outputFormat = new AudioFormat ( 44100, 16, 2, true, false ); 
					DataLine.Info datalineInfo = new DataLine.Info( SourceDataLine.class, outputFormat );
					SourceDataLine audioOutput = (SourceDataLine) AudioSystem.getLine( datalineInfo );
					audioOutput.open( outputFormat );
			
			Plan: 
				Setup a pool for line outs, spawn new ones as needed, and pull from the pool when you can.
				Keep track of how many could potentially get open. How many is too many? 
	
		
	UI
	
		Library Source Directories - highlight in red if they are missing. 
		
		Overwite a playlist -> Get prompted -> Select "Yes" to save -> Hit cancel on the next dialog -> Thing is overwritten. Instead cancel the change.
		
		Make all alerts and prompts use theme
			FXUI.promptAndSavePlaylist
			FXUI.alertUser
			
			Change color on alert default buttons:
				https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47744440/css-selector-for-default-button-in-a-javafx-alert
				
		Lyric search - if they all fail, try removing all parenthesied text from song name and try again
		
		
		Export playlist as a folder
			Copy all of the music files into that folder. Prepend them with index number? 
			Warn if the total copy is larger than X MB or more than X tracks
			

		The hack to reload the first track isn't working. Sometimes the delay is too long and the tracks aren't sync'd, so the first track plays twice
	
		Volume Slider 
			Slide it down to mute, then click mute button. Strange stuff happens. 
			
			doesn't feel right. Do some math formual instead of linear
			in windows goes past 100%
	
		Bug report dialog
	
		current list play/pause images don't change colors immediately. Have to play a new track to get updateImageThemes() to call.
		
		Add default sort column choice, like shuffle and repeat
		
		Persist column sort options
		
		Album list - Display disc and release type in different color font
	
		Hide some columns
			https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27696578/javafx8-anchoring-tableview-columns-contextmenu-immediately-below-the-the-colu
			
		Hover effects on transparent image buttons
			Settings Button
			Volume button
		
		Loader status % complete thing
		
		Put a filter on images when in light theme to make them slightly grey (or dampen the actual images).
		
		Tag Window, next and previous button
			If we're looking at a single currentListTrack, add next and previous buttons and cycle through current list. That's it. 
			
		Dark theme for about tab settings
			
		Revisit fonts -- Do we need to include the font files? 
						
		~incomplete/Grizzly Bear
			F2 to show tag editor, no content in table
		
		Hide the library table drop down
			drag vertical divider all the way left then back to center, the drop down appears. Hide it. 
	
		Show something on art boxes to differentiate between artist and album, especially when drag & dropping
	
		Drag and drop from misc places to system
			playlist table -> m3u
			track table, history, queue, info windows, current table -> single tracks
			album table -> folder
			
		Consistent in-program hotkeys & tab in settings window for in-program hotkeys.

	Tag auto fix button
	
	I don't like the way the library line wraps in the manifest. Can we make this nicer in ant? 
	
		
	Ok this should address a number of issues that people have been having including this one. Please test and let me know if this issue can be closed.

JavaFX stuff
		
	Tray Icon
		I have a few demos that are all terrible. It looks like we need to wait for JavaFX to get this going for us. 
		Or maybe just show an icon with no menus. Kinda hate that. How do we exit?

	While loading the library, the table view scrolls a little bit. 
	
	Tiny drop shadow on transport buttons when in dark theme. It's the line HBox, VBox, #transport { ... -fx-background-color: #222222 ... }
	
	Table header alignment:
		Platform.runLater(() -> tableView.refresh());
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37423748/javafx-tablecolumns-headers-not-aligned-with-cells-due-to-vertical-scrollbar
	
	
Refactor / organize my code. 
 	Make LibraryUpdater part of Library. Is there a way to abstract out the Platform -> RunLater part? I feel like we're just stuck w/ that, which kind of ties to us JavaFX. 
 		Maybe ui.runMe ( Runnable ), and then the UI can decide whether to launch a new thread, have a thread idling, do it on this thread, or use something like Platform.runLater()	

 	Make MainWindow its own class, and have FXUI be more of a simple manager? 
 	
	use observable values for all of the track and album stuff, so we don't have to do refreshes
	
	a better structure for persister
	
	a better structure for hotkey commands (maybe combine with commandline commands?)
	
	Move all the file browser calls into a single function

	Mp4
		buffered input stream on the random access File stream
		
	Ogg
		Works, seeking is done using read() instead of skip(), so it's a little slow.
		
	m4b - Fast play for some reason
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44750751/why-are-m4bs-playing-at-faster-speeds
		I need to set the sample rate to one of these: 96000, 88200, 64000, 48000, 44100, 32000, 24000, 22050, 16000, 12000, 11025, 8000, 7350 
		The files seem te report the wrong sample rate. JAAD acutally reads them. 
		
	Flac
		Can we get flacplayer.java to play things that we need jflac for:
			Adrian Orange
			A Perfect Circle - Mer de noms
			Pink Floyd - Pulse (disc 1)
			
		buffered input stream on the random access File stream
