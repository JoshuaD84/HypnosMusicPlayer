New Features
	Add a "Listen" menu on the track table. Plays the track without changing the current list
	
	Styles
		Dark
		Light
			File stylesheet = new File ( "style.css" );
			scene.getStylesheets().add( "file:///" + stylesheet.getAbsolutePath().replace( "\\", "/" ) ); //TODO: DD
	
	Hot Keys
		
	Error notifications	
		Have there be an in-program way to view error log? Or at least, view it using the system text editor. 

	Some way to get the file name corresponding to a file in the current list. 
		Use album info window or something like it? 
	
	Current List Info
		Show total length of currentlist somewhere.  
		Maybe show current playing track info, like bitrate, etc. This would probably go in a status bar at the bottom. 

	When you click on an album on the list, show it in the art pane for a little bit? 
	
	Control volume via commandline
	
	Tag Window, next and previous button?  
	
	Log to file, how does that work inside java? 
	
	If the current playing track is next in Queue, have the playing indicator show that, maybe
	
	Add a "Preview" right click menu for any track (not albums or playlists)
		Maybe provide an option in a settings window that lets you define which thing happens when you double click, preview or set
		
	DND the first disc of an album, then dnd the second disc, adding to the list. It makes a new playlist. 
		
	Option: Warn when erasing an unsaved playlist. 
	
	Double click a single track anywhere -> preview, don't mess with current list. 
	
	Double click an album or playlist -> erase the queue. 
	
Bug Fixes / Incremental Improvements

	
	After persist
		track position not set and transport pending/elapsed not showing
		tracks on current list that are in queue aren't linked. 
		Do we want to remember which tab in the library pane is showing?
		paused current track doesn't have the title text or the slider thumb
		History is only saving or loading 1 track, not the full history. 
		Save the current playlist so we can setup the SoundSystem and ListInfoTextBox
			
	Update my interruptedException handling:

		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26856242/interruptedexception-what-causes-it
	
	use observable values for all of the track and album stuff, so we don't have to do refreshes

	Make it so filtering long lists isn't laggy. Some way of delaying processing, skipping some letters? Do we need to add the predicate everytime like we are?
	
	If playlists folder doesn't exist, it doesn't save playlists and doens't create it. 
		
	Changing tag information doesn't update all the proper places.
		Changing disc info on album list
		changing album info when the album is loaded in current list. 
	
	Make sure horizontal scroll bars never appear
		6/9 - Can't find anything on google.

	Remember windowed-width even if maximized
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44636866/save-and-set-the-not-maximized-window-size
				
	Editing multiple album artists doesn't seem to work - Dusty Fingers
	
	Make sure the text labels for time left and time elapsed are padded to NN:NN:NN, to avoid stuff moving.

	Doube click an album - > watch console. It pauses for a loop before unpausing. Delay in opening feels like lag. 
	
	
Refactor / organize my code. 
 	Make LibraryUpdater part of Library. Is there a way to abstract out the Platform -> RunLater part? I feel like we're just stuck w/ that, which kind of ties to us JavaFX. 
 	
 	Can / should I get rid of Utils?
 	
 	Make MainWindow its own class, and have FXUI be more of a simple manager? 

Decoders
	Mp4
		buffered input stream on the random access File stream
		
	Ogg
		Works, seeking is done using read() instead of skip(), so it's a little slow.
		
	m4b - Fast play for some reason
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44750751/why-are-m4bs-playing-at-faster-speeds
		I need to set the sample rate to one of these: 96000, 88200, 64000, 48000, 44100, 32000, 24000, 22050, 16000, 12000, 11025, 8000, 7350 
		The files seem te report the wrong sample rate. JAAD acutally reads them. 
		
	Flac
		Can we get flacplayer.java to play things that we need jflac for:
			Adrian Orange
			A Perfect Circle - Mer de noms
			Pink Floyd - Pulse (disc 1)
			
		buffered input stream on the random access File stream
