Before Beta 2:		
	test linux 32 bit and windows, make sure the jre works
	

General:	
	After giving volume notification, it's hard to hit play and have the right track play. Maybe start it paused instead of stopping? 

	isArtistDirectory -- Keep a cache, so you're not checking every folder every time? Might need to recheck occasionally. 
	
	Windows 7 - Songs with strange characters display as noise -- Neon Genesis Evangelion
		
	Missing tracks are deleted from currentlist after restart if CurrentList.mode == ALBUM instead of remaining and being highlighted in red
	
	Esc Hotkey	
		album, track, and playlist problem -- it currently closes window regardless. 
		tagWindow & settings Window - this is a little difficult because esc also stops editing a cell
						
	Show in tag edit window when a file doesn't support a particular tag type

	Refactor Library
		Make a source directory a class, not just a path.
			Library Source Directories - highlight in red if they are missing. 

		An album will form from tracks if you edit them and they aren't currently an album. But an album won't split if you edit tags and make it not be an album.
			Is this desired behavior? I feel like probably no -- it can create different states based on the same disk contents, which doesn't make sense
			
		Albums aren't updating on the album list when you edit tags. Probably because they're behind in the update queue or I broke album.update
		
		Sometimes there are duplicated tracks in the track list
		
		When removing all sources, it takes a long time to remove everything (5+ seconds)
			This is because of the processWatcherEvents function taking lots of time on load. 
			
		Setup a currentList.updateAlbum and updatePlaylist system
			Doesn't change artwork
			CurrentplayingTrack is the same one
			updates data and locations
			
		Library load and unload time
		
		Loader status % complete thing
		
	Resize Policy
		Windowed mode, shrink window until a scrollbar appears. Maximize window so scrollbar disappears -- Scrollbar width is still accounted for
		
		Scrollbar width is calculated wrong by 4 pixels. I have it hardcoded, but I posted a SE question
			https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47852175/get-full-width-of-scrollbar-for-a-tableview
		
		CustomResizePolicy is not called when double clicking on table header dividers to shrink wrap	
			https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47852239/customresizepolicy-not-triggering-when-a-columns-headers-divider-is-double-cli

	Tag auto fix button
				
	persist column info
		sort options
		ordering
	
	I don't like the way the library line wraps in the manifest. Can we make this nicer in ant? 
	
	Bug report dialog
	
	Export playlist as a folder
		Copy all of the music files into that folder. Prepend them with index number? 
		Warn if the total copy is larger than X MB or more than X tracks
	
	Drag and drop from misc places to system
		playlist table -> m3u
		track table, history, queue, info windows, current table -> single tracks
		album table -> folder
	
	Add default sort column choice, like shuffle and repeat
	
	Hover effects on transparent image buttons
		Settings Button
		Volume button
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47765228/is-it-possible-to-set-tthe-hsv-for-a-color-adjust-via-css
		settingsButton.setOnMouseEntered( e -> settingsImage.setEffect( this.darkThemeButtonsHover ) );
		settingsButton.setOnMouseExited( e -> settingsImage.setEffect( isDarkTheme()? darkThemeButtons : null ) );
		This is kind of a pain. We need to hard code the values, convert from hsv to color adjust, and also probably have white button images instead of black. 
				
	If you load albumsAndTracks but not sources Hypnos acts real wierd. Goes back and forth between not responding. On Windows confirmed.  	
					
	Memory Hog issue	
		With an empty library and no current list and nothing loaded uses about 175mb on Windows 7.
			Clicking around the UI and using every UI feature except for loading library or tracks can climb it to about 300mb
			loading a folder of 58 albums climbs the usage to ~400mb. Removing seems to push it to 411mb
			loading a folder of 2460 albums climbs to the usage to 1.7GB
			closing and reopening 
			closing and reopening:
				drives it up to 1.4gb + (i'm sure it would keep going for a while longer)
				with library loader and library updater disabled puts the memory at 320mb
				with updater disabled puts the memory at 1.2+ (probably would've kept climbing)
				with loader disabled it stops at ~367mb. 
			
			SO loader is a source of memory consumption definitely. 
				-Xmx600m fixed this on windows 7. Kept it floating around 450mb. 
			
		loading images definitely makes it real bad. Fixing that will help, but won't solve it. 
		
		scrolling up and down the album or track table table does increase memory usage, but "only" by 100-200mb. 
		
		Start Hypnos
		Load a big library ( /d/music)
		Let it finish loading
		Close and reopen hypnos
		1.6GB memory footprint
		
		Start Hypnos
		Load a big library (/d/music)
		during load -- 1.26GB
		after load - 721MB
		after restart hypnos - 1.5GB
		it seems to stay there. I let it run for about 10 minutes, no drop in memory usage. 
		
		stopping the libraryUpdater and libraryLoader seems to cut into the problem tremendously
		
		Even after stopping updater and loader, it creeps up. It looks like everytime a new song is played?
			confirmed. Each new song spikes the memory. Just flipping through the songs without playing them causes it
				Is this related to the skipping issue? - doesn't seem to be with one or two tracks after ramping up the memory
			Was able to get it to 3 GB just by flipping through tracks. Could probably go higher. 
		
		flipping through tracks quickly by hitting next button also causes memory spike. Not terrible. 
				
		2017/12/25 - I was able to temper this problem significantly by having only one image loader thread and by setting -Xmx
		
	Redo global hotkeys, do it on a system-by-system type basis.
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79658/react-on-global-hotkey-in-a-java-program-on-windows-linux-mac
		Some Global Hotkeys aren't consumed - Win + C, Win + X, etc.  
			
		Windows:
			jkeymaster - windows + x keys not supported
			
			JHotKeys - I can't find a jar, and having trouble building one. 
		
			JNativeHook: Hotkey consumption for win keys is bad -- if you press win + v it works, but if you release the win button first, stuff breaks badly 
				
		Linux
			http://sourceforge.net/projects/jxgrabkey/
			
			JNativeHook - No consumption of hotkey
		
	Windows - Volume takes a split second to change. 	
		
JavaFX stuff
	Double clicking on table-column dividers doesn't call resize:

	Tray Icon
		I have a few demos that are all terrible. It looks like we need to wait for JavaFX to get this going for us. 
		Or maybe just show an icon with no menus. Kinda hate that. How do we exit? 
		Gnome 3 doesn't support. Code works but creates a bad entry on taskbar.
		What systems do support? 
		What other systems don't support? How to handle?

	Tiny drop shadow on transport buttons when in dark theme. It's the line HBox, VBox, #transport { ... -fx-background-color: #222222 ... }
	
Refactor / organize my code. 
 	Make LibraryUpdater part of Library. Is there a way to abstract out the Platform -> RunLater part? I feel like we're just stuck w/ that, which kind of ties to us JavaFX. 
 		Maybe ui.runMe ( Runnable ), and then the UI can decide whether to launch a new thread, have a thread idling, do it on this thread, or use something like Platform.runLater()	

 	Make MainWindow its own class, and have FXUI be more of a simple manager? 
 	
	use observable values for all of the track and album stuff, so we don't have to do refreshes
	
	a better structure for persister
	
	a better structure for hotkey commands (maybe combine with commandline commands?)
	
	Move all the file browser calls into a single function
	
	Make a single function for setting up right click menus, or at least combine a bunch. We have so many big chunks of the same code. 

Decoders

		buffered input stream on the random access File stream
		
	Ogg
		Works, seeking is done using read() instead of skip(), so it's a little slow.
		
	m4b - Fast play for some reason
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44750751/why-are-m4bs-playing-at-faster-speeds
		I need to set the sample rate to one of these: 96000, 88200, 64000, 48000, 44100, 32000, 24000, 22050, 16000, 12000, 11025, 8000, 7350 
		The files seem te report the wrong sample rate. JAAD acutally reads them. 
		
	Flac
		Can we get flacplayer.java to play things that we need jflac for:
			Adrian Orange
			A Perfect Circle - Mer de noms
			Pink Floyd - Pulse (disc 1)
