Some way to get the file name corresponding to a file in the current list. 
	Use album info window or something like it? 

Show total length of currentlist somewhere.  

Maybe show current playing track info, like bitrate, etc. This would probably go in a status bar at the bottom. 

link the persisted current playing file w/ the current list if it's on there

Remember windowed-width even if maximized

Redesign the transport

Tray icon
	Gnome 3 doesn't support. Code works but creates a bad entry on taskbar.
	What systems do support? 
	What other systems don't support? How to handle? 

Refactor / organize my code. 
 	Separate player / ui systems. 
 	
 	Re-design the code for the current playing info box above the current list.
 	
 	Have a single thread handle playing all tracks. Have it be the same thread that accepts requests rather than spawning new threads off UI actions.
