	I got rid of the possibility of a Track throwing an exception while loading.  
		I feel like I should be doing more responsible things there.
		Why couldn't I load it? Can I make a note, maybe in the tag error log? Do I need to? 
		Plan: Watch for problems. I feel like maybe no problems will arise.
		
	Power being cut still erases all data
	
Testing pre-beta release info				

Post Beta New Features		
	Art pane min size is annoying
	
	Add default sort column choice, like shuffle and repeat
	
	Current list - sort by > drop list. 
	
	Persist column sort options
	
	Album list - Display disc and release type in different color font
					
	Tag auto fix button
	
	Settings button hover color -- should be blue
	
	Manifest details - set version and other info, read it into Hypnos, show in About tab
	
	Loader status % complete thing
	
	Put a filter on images when in light theme to make them slightly grey (or dampen the actual images).
	
	Have the 2nd instance of hypnos call --bring-to-front or whatever it's called if there are no arguments to second instance call
	
	
Post Beta fixes / updates / improvements 

	Hide the library table drop down
		drag vertical divider all the way left then back to center, the drop down appears. Hide it. 

	Setup a currentList.updateAlbum and updatePlaylist system
		Doesn't change artwork
		CurrentplayingTrack is the same one
		updates data and locations
		
	When removing all sources, it takes a long time to remove everything (5+ seconds)
		This is because of the processWatcherEvents function taking lots of time on load. 
		
	Show something on art boxes to differentiate between artist and album, especially when drag & dropping
	
	Icons on popup windows
			
	~incomplete/Grizzly Bear
		F2 to show tag editor, no content in table
		
	Sometimes there are duplicated tracks in the track list
	
	Show images in tag window
		Allow the deletion of embedded images
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17067481/javafx-2-tableview-different-cell-factory-depending-on-the-data-inside-the-cel
		
	Change css selector for .scroll-bar:horizontal to an applied class, so only chosen h-scrollbars are hidden

	Library load and unload time
	
	have filter boxes share text, so they feel like one box. 
	
	UI thread crashes a lot. When it does, I can't resize window
		I fixed some places where this can happen. Are there others? Need to watch for them. 

	Show play / pause icon on taskbar
	
	Dark theme for about tab settings
	
	Tag Window change "Track" to "Track #"
	
JavaFX stuff
	hide/show via hotkeys while maximized toggles every 3 presses instead of every 2 presses. 
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45269173/stage-seticonified-and-stage-isiconified-not-acting-properly
	
	While loading the library, the table view scrolls a little bit. 
	
	Tiny drop shadow on transport buttons when in dark theme. It's the line HBox, VBox, #transport { ... -fx-background-color: #222222 ... }
	
Refactor / organize my code. 
 	Make LibraryUpdater part of Library. Is there a way to abstract out the Platform -> RunLater part? I feel like we're just stuck w/ that, which kind of ties to us JavaFX. 
 		Maybe ui.runMe ( Runnable ), and then the UI can decide whether to launch a new thread, have a thread idling, do it on this thread, or use something like Platform.runLater()	

 	Make MainWindow its own class, and have FXUI be more of a simple manager? 
 	
	use observable values for all of the track and album stuff, so we don't have to do refreshes
	
	a better structure for persister
	
	a better structure for hotkey commands (maybe combine with commandline commands?)
	
	Move all the file browser calls into a single function

Decoders
	Mp4
		buffered input stream on the random access File stream
		
	Ogg
		Works, seeking is done using read() instead of skip(), so it's a little slow.
		
	m4b - Fast play for some reason
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44750751/why-are-m4bs-playing-at-faster-speeds
		I need to set the sample rate to one of these: 96000, 88200, 64000, 48000, 44100, 32000, 24000, 22050, 16000, 12000, 11025, 8000, 7350 
		The files seem te report the wrong sample rate. JAAD acutally reads them. 
		
	Flac
		Can we get flacplayer.java to play things that we need jflac for:
			Adrian Orange
			A Perfect Circle - Mer de noms
			Pink Floyd - Pulse (disc 1)
			
		buffered input stream on the random access File stream

OS Specific		
	All:
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7506329/embed-java-into-a-c-application

	Windows
		Open-with shell integration
		Installer
	    Standalone build (32-bit)
		Rename java process to Hypnos
		
	Linux
		use a compiled launcher rather than a script -- this will make the appimage nicer I think
		Standalone build - Linux64 embedded JRE
		Standalone build - Linux32 embedded JRE
		Rename java process to Hypnos
		
		Gnome3 
			Right click -> Open with -- loads the files to current list, but doesn't start playing. 
			
		Always use Dejavu font? 
	
	OSX
		Does our package work? 
		Open-with shell integration
		.DMG installer
		Rename java process to Hypnos ?
		
		Always use LucidaGrande font?
		Test global hotkeys
		
	Tray icon
		Gnome 3 doesn't support. Code works but creates a bad entry on taskbar.
		What systems do support? 
		What other systems don't support? How to handle? 
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29995727/java-systemtray-icon-does-not-always-work
		
	Use local fonts? 		
		DejaVu Sans - The thing I'm using on nix
		Calibri - Windows
		Lucida Grande - OSX
		
			try { 
			    Font.loadFont(new FileInputStream(new File("stage/font/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf")), 12);

Future Features, maybe:

	System tray

	Tag Window, next and previous button
		
	Drag and drop from misc places to system
		playlist table -> m3u
		track table, history, queue, info windows, current table -> single tracks
		album table -> folder
	
	Tab in settings window for in-program hotkeys. 
			
	Add tag image info to tag window
	
	backup playlists
