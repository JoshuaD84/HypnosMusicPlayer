Playlists don't get deleted from disk when deleted from UI

Tracks loaded from playlists aren't linked to albums in library

Genius Parser and AZ Parsrer don't seem to be working ever




Linux
   JavaFX / Linux Open File Dialog sometimes causes jvm crash, depends on system, and doesn't happen always
   
   Right click on table headers causes re-sort

   Gnome - title on taskbar is set as net.joshuad.hypnos.Hypnos

   Gnome - See how sys tray interacts w/ topiconsplus extension

   Linux: Dynamic menu titles in system tray
      This is kind of a pain because of the icons and because I'm bad at C

Windows
   Select Multiple Files in explorer - No Option to play in Hypnos. Add that
   "Open with" causes the current track button to not show the current track's name.
   Commandline Interface
      Send a file via command line when hypnos isn't playing -- it starts
      Then do it again with hypnos playing, it doesn't start playing the new track, just puts it on current list

Library
   If something gets dropped into config/playlists folders, update the UI to include it?

Backend
   Build jxgrabhotkey as a seperate jar

   Having three different throttled filter classes is really error prone. Clean that up, unify 
      Playlist throttled filter, but who's going to have over 1000 playlists?

   Look at getting completely off swing, we can shave a lot out of the jres if we do
      It's currently being used to:
         * open a file using native program
         * browse using native browser
         * Turn an fxImage into a bufferedImage
         * Turn a bufferedImage into an fxImage

   Artist hasn't been fully converted to the observable paradigm yet, so there are problems
      If you open an artist window and delete a file, it isn't removed from the artist window list

   Filtering the track or album list causes exceptions
      2019-07-08 - I made it happen way less frequently by wrapping it in a runLater(), but I was still able to get
      a crash by really spamming the search boxes

   Can we use Java's Jigsaw to reduce distribution size somehow? We had issues w/ circular dependencies, but can we work
   through that?

   Windows - It locks artist folders on windows. Surpsingly not album folders, just artist

Decoder  
   I found an MP3 that Hypnos refuses to play. VLC plays it.
   http://traffic.libsyn.com/fash-the-nation/FTN_020319.mp3

   Windows: better decoder, stutters at beginning of each track
   
   Linux seems fine, and if we do system integration the cost to install vlc isn't as high, so windows is the bigger
   focus

   Linux: Sometimes it doesn't make sound after restarting into the paused state.  
   
   Tom Waits - Blue Valentines - Buggy on my 18.04? 

UI
   Add buttons to library scan log window
      Clear log
      copy log
      Maybe select different types of things, like albums rejected, full list, etc. 

   File-Tree view for library
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57025089/stop-javafx-treeview-from-jumping-when-an-item-is-expanded
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29402412/how-to-get-javafx-treeview-to-behave-consistently-upon-node-expansion?rq=1

   Make artist tab a tree view:
      + Artist
         + Album
            + Track
         Loose Track

   visual position slider

Future
   Windows - Build Process


   Linux: Media Buttons
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53550397/javafx-keyevent-is-it-possible-to-get-more-info-for-undefined-events

   column widths don't resize right when you change the window size right as the program starts
      Confirmed with configuration Cols A B C D, with B C D being no-resize via hypnosresizepolicy

   Windows: Move to next monitor with ultramon and minimize to system tray dont play well together
      User can just disable minimize to system tray and still close to system tray, so whatever nbd

	Mounted Audio CDs

   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51851572/java-fx-button-is-staying-pressed-after-drag-event

	Can I expand encoding information display using vlc?

	Windows - First hover over the love button makes it shift positions
		Launch Hypnos without lastfm widgets showing
		turn on last fm widgets
		hover over love button -- it shifts
		If you launch with lastfm showing, doesn't happen

	KDE Neon
		Can't drag ad drop an mp3 into hypnos
			onDragOver doesn't seem to hear the drag event.

		User said it opened the track instead of opening folder. Confirmed on KDE Neon image on my computer, it opened gwenview

	Drag and drop from misc places to system
		playlist table -> m3u
		track table, history, queue, info windows, current table -> copy single tracks

	Tag auto fix button

	Maybe add sorting of roman numerals?
		https://gist.github.com/julienhaversano/9197588

	Maybe allow a filter for file type and lossy vs not lossy
		Maybe just a special search text "type:mp3", "type:lossy"
		I dunno making search box script is alot.
		
	Windows
		NSIS
			Version number dynamically assigned

			Open-with shell integration
				http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Add_your_app_in_each_EXE_in_the_context_menu

				This is pretty close. It makes an entry but it doesn't work. Could be a lot of different problems.
				WriteRegStr HKCR ".flac\shell\Hypnos\command" "" "$INSTDIR\Hypnos.exe $\"%1$\""

		When you launch show busy mouse cursor

:::: Refactor / organize my code ::::
	a better structure for hotkey commands (maybe combine with commandline commands?)
