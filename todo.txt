TODO	
	Playback locks sometimes, haven't figured out why
	
	Current list jump-to or filter or something
	
	Opening m3us at the commandline doesn't work right. It puts the m3u on the current list instead of parsing it
	
	Play CDs
	
	Make the volume button a little smaller
	
	Tray Icon
	
	Play mounted audio cd
	
	current list play/pause images don't change colors immediately. Have to play a new track to get updateImageThemes() to call.

	Art pane min size is annoying
	
	Library Source Directories - highlight in red if they are missing. 
	
	Bug report dialog
	
	Add default sort column choice, like shuffle and repeat
		
	Persist column sort options
	
	Strip out the sdk from the 64bit jdk, and only include the jre -- see what I did for the 32 bit setup
	
	Album list - Display disc and release type in different color font
					
	Tag auto fix button
	
	Settings button hover color -- should be blue
		
	I don't like the way the library line wraps in the manifest. Can we make this nicer in ant? 
	
	Loader status % complete thing
	
	Put a filter on images when in light theme to make them slightly grey (or dampen the actual images).
	
	Have the 2nd instance of hypnos call --bring-to-front or whatever it's called if there are no arguments to second instance call
	
	System tray

	Tag Window, next and previous button
		
	Drag and drop from misc places to system
		playlist table -> m3u
		track table, history, queue, info windows, current table -> single tracks
		album table -> folder
	
	Tab in settings window for in-program hotkeys. 
				
	backup playlists
	
	Warn before discarding unsaved playlist -- button order (Yes, no, cancel instead of No, Yes, Cancel)	
		

	On a very small screen (800x600) hypnos is too big and it doesn't fit. 
	
	Ok this should address a number of issues that people have been having including this one. Please test and let me know if this issue can be closed.

	Hide the library table drop down
		drag vertical divider all the way left then back to center, the drop down appears. Hide it. 

	Setup a currentList.updateAlbum and updatePlaylist system
		Doesn't change artwork
		CurrentplayingTrack is the same one
		updates data and locations
		
	When removing all sources, it takes a long time to remove everything (5+ seconds)
		This is because of the processWatcherEvents function taking lots of time on load. 
		
	Show something on art boxes to differentiate between artist and album, especially when drag & dropping
	
	Icons on popup windows
			
	~incomplete/Grizzly Bear
		F2 to show tag editor, no content in table
		
	Sometimes there are duplicated tracks in the track list
	
	Show images in tag window
		Allow the deletion of embedded images

	Change css selector for .scroll-bar:horizontal to an applied class, so only chosen h-scrollbars are hidden

	Library load and unload time
	
	have filter boxes share text, so they feel like one box.
	
	Center "Hypnos Running" window on all screens 
	
	Show play / pause icon on taskbar
	
	Dark theme for about tab settings
	
	Tag Window change "Track" to "Track #"
	
	Revisit fonts -- Do we need to include the font files? 
	
	Trying to play back https://archive.org/download/testmp3testfile/mpthreetest.mp3 using 
	http://hypnosplayer.org/download/beta1/Hypnos-nix-64bit-beta1.AppImage on Xubuntu 16.04 gives a very high-pitch voice, not how it should sound.

	While loading the library, the table view scrolls a little bit. 
	
	Tiny drop shadow on transport buttons when in dark theme. It's the line HBox, VBox, #transport { ... -fx-background-color: #222222 ... }
	
	Table header alignment:
		Platform.runLater(() -> tableView.refresh());
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37423748/javafx-tablecolumns-headers-not-aligned-with-cells-due-to-vertical-scrollbar
	
Refactor / organize my code. 
 	Make LibraryUpdater part of Library. Is there a way to abstract out the Platform -> RunLater part? I feel like we're just stuck w/ that, which kind of ties to us JavaFX. 
 		Maybe ui.runMe ( Runnable ), and then the UI can decide whether to launch a new thread, have a thread idling, do it on this thread, or use something like Platform.runLater()	

 	Make MainWindow its own class, and have FXUI be more of a simple manager? 
 	
	use observable values for all of the track and album stuff, so we don't have to do refreshes
	
	a better structure for persister
	
	a better structure for hotkey commands (maybe combine with commandline commands?)
	
	Move all the file browser calls into a single function

	Ogg
		Works, seeking is done using read() instead of skip(), so it's a little slow.
		
	m4b - Fast play for some reason
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44750751/why-are-m4bs-playing-at-faster-speeds
		I need to set the sample rate to one of these: 96000, 88200, 64000, 48000, 44100, 32000, 24000, 22050, 16000, 12000, 11025, 8000, 7350 
		The files seem te report the wrong sample rate. JAAD acutally reads them. 
		
	Flac
		Can we get flacplayer.java to play things that we need jflac for:
			Adrian Orange
			A Perfect Circle - Mer de noms
			Pink Floyd - Pulse (disc 1)
