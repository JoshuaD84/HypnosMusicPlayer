If you load it with no music roots (maybe only after an unexpected shutdown) then add a music root, it does not start
   scanning. You have to restart hypnos to get the scanner started. 

Load time feels a little long
   It's persister -> loadPlaylists .... library.linkPlaylistToLibrary()

Delete only playlist

Show the current list track count somewhere, maybe by the length indicator

Linux
   JavaFX / Linux Open File Dialog sometimes causes jvm crash, depends on system, and doesn't happen always
   
   Right click on table headers causes re-sort

   Gnome - title on taskbar is set as net.joshuad.hypnos.Hypnos

   Gnome - See how sys tray interacts w/ topiconsplus extension

Backend
   Artist hasn't been fully converted to the observable paradigm yet, so there are problems
      If you open an artist window and delete a file, it isn't removed from the currently open artist window list

Decoder  
   Opus and Ape support

   I found an MP3 that Hypnos refuses to play. VLC plays it.

   Windows: better decoder, stutters at beginning of each track
   
   Linux seems fine, and if we do system integration the cost to install vlc isn't as high, so windows is the bigger
   focus

   Linux: Sometimes it doesn't make sound after restarting into the paused state.

UI
   Add buttons to library scan log window
      Clear log
      copy log
      Maybe select different types of things, like albums rejected, full list, etc. 

Before beta 7 release
   check if a beta 6 history causes right click -> play to give exception
      step 1: install beta 6
      step 2: play some tracks such that there is a history
      step 3: close, install beta 7
      step 4: right click -> play on current list track. Does the menu disappear? Good. If not, address

   Windows - Change exe to communicate directly through socket, to avoid launching JVM a bunch when doing "open with" on
      multiple files

   Having three different throttled filter classes is really error prone. Clean that up, unify 
      Playlist throttled filter, but who's going to have over 1000 playlists?

   Filtering the track or album list causes exceptions
      2019-07-08 - I made it happen way less frequently by wrapping it in a runLater(), but I was still able to get
      a crash by really spamming the search boxes

   Look at getting completely off swing, we can shave a lot out of the jres if we do
      It's currently being used to:
         * open a file using native program
         * browse using native browser
         * Turn an fxImage into a bufferedImage
         * Turn a bufferedImage into an fxImage

   Make artist tab a tree view:
      + Artist
         + Album
            + Track
         Loose Track

   visual position slider

   Linux: Dynamic menu titles in system tray
      This is kind of a pain because of the icons and because I'm bad at C

   If something gets dropped into config/playlists folders, update the UI to include it?

   Windows - Build Process

   Search for artist image in other locations in library if not found here.  Make it an option with a checkbox

   Linux: Media Buttons

   column widths don't resize right when you change the window size right as the program starts
      Confirmed with configuration Cols A B C D, with B C D being no-resize via hypnosresizepolicy

   Windows: Move to next monitor with ultramon and minimize to system tray dont play well together
      User can just disable minimize to system tray and still close to system tray, so whatever nbd

	Can I expand encoding information display using vlc?

	Windows - First hover over the love button makes it shift positions
		Launch Hypnos without lastfm widgets showing
		turn on last fm widgets
		hover over love button -- it shifts
		If you launch with lastfm showing, doesn't happen

	KDE Neon
		Can't drag ad drop an mp3 into hypnos
			onDragOver doesn't seem to hear the drag event.

		User said it opened the track instead of opening folder. Confirmed on KDE Neon image on my computer, it opened gwenview

	Drag and drop from misc places to system
		playlist table -> m3u
		track table, history, queue, info windows, current table -> copy single tracks

	Tag auto fix button

	Maybe add sorting of roman numerals?
		https://gist.github.com/julienhaversano/9197588

	Maybe allow a filter for file type and lossy vs not lossy
		Maybe just a special search text "type:mp3", "type:lossy"
		I dunno making search box script is alot.
		
	Windows
		NSIS
			Version number dynamically assigned

		When you launch show busy mouse cursor

   Make sure we see all system.out in log window

	a better structure for hotkey commands (maybe combine with commandline commands?)
