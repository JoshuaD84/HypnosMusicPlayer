New Features	
	Hot Keys
		
	Error notifications	
		Have there be an in-program way to view error log? Or at least, a button to view it using the system text editor. 

	Some way to get the file name corresponding to a file in the current list. 
		Use album info window or something like it? 
	
	Maybe show current playing track info, like bitrate, etc.
	
	Log to file, how does that work inside java? 
			
	Option: Warn when erasing an unsaved playlist. 
			
Bug Fixes / Incremental Improvements

	use observable values for all of the track and album stuff, so we don't have to do refreshes
	
	Make sure horizontal scroll bars never appear
		6/9 - Can't find anything on google.
	
	Some bugs on the currentListInfoLabel. Work them out one at a time. 	
		DND the first disc of an album, then dnd the second disc, inserting in the middle -> it should show modified, but it doesn't 
		
	Flipping through albums / tracks with up and down arrow doesn't update the art pane. 
		
		
Refactor / organize my code. 
 	Make LibraryUpdater part of Library. Is there a way to abstract out the Platform -> RunLater part? I feel like we're just stuck w/ that, which kind of ties to us JavaFX. 
 		Maybe ui.runMe ( Runnable ), and then the UI can decide whether to launch a new thread, have a thread idling, do it on this thread, or use something like Platform.runLater()	
 	
 	Can / should I get rid of Utils?
 	
 	Make MainWindow its own class, and have FXUI be more of a simple manager? 

Decoders
	Mp4
		buffered input stream on the random access File stream
		
	Ogg
		Works, seeking is done using read() instead of skip(), so it's a little slow.
		
	m4b - Fast play for some reason
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44750751/why-are-m4bs-playing-at-faster-speeds
		I need to set the sample rate to one of these: 96000, 88200, 64000, 48000, 44100, 32000, 24000, 22050, 16000, 12000, 11025, 8000, 7350 
		The files seem te report the wrong sample rate. JAAD acutally reads them. 
		
	Flac
		Can we get flacplayer.java to play things that we need jflac for:
			Adrian Orange
			A Perfect Circle - Mer de noms
			Pink Floyd - Pulse (disc 1)
			
		buffered input stream on the random access File stream

Future Features, maybe:
	Tag Window, next and previous button
	
	Dark Stylesheet 
	
	
Note
	You can increase the slider button size by increasing the font size.
