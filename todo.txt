	Some way to get the file name corresponding to a file in the current list. 
		Use album info window or something like it? 
		
	Log to file, how does that work inside java? 
		
	try to play a missing file. It keeps throwing exception. Only throw it once.
	
	have escape on lists clear selection.

Bug Fixes / Incremental Improvements
	
	Make sure horizontal scroll bars never appear
		6/9 - Can't find anything on google.
		
	Be a little more selective about what images we accept for album/artist. Random files on desktop get annoying images. 
	
	Persister.loadCurrentList()
		This is from trying to run a new version of hypnos after having data from a previous version.

	Make the tag error window more user-friendly. 
			
Refactor / organize my code. 
 	Make LibraryUpdater part of Library. Is there a way to abstract out the Platform -> RunLater part? I feel like we're just stuck w/ that, which kind of ties to us JavaFX. 
 		Maybe ui.runMe ( Runnable ), and then the UI can decide whether to launch a new thread, have a thread idling, do it on this thread, or use something like Platform.runLater()	

 	Make MainWindow its own class, and have FXUI be more of a simple manager? 
 	
	use observable values for all of the track and album stuff, so we don't have to do refreshes

	Mp4
		buffered input stream on the random access File stream
		
	Ogg
		Works, seeking is done using read() instead of skip(), so it's a little slow.
		
	m4b - Fast play for some reason
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44750751/why-are-m4bs-playing-at-faster-speeds
		I need to set the sample rate to one of these: 96000, 88200, 64000, 48000, 44100, 32000, 24000, 22050, 16000, 12000, 11025, 8000, 7350 
		The files seem te report the wrong sample rate. JAAD acutally reads them. 
		
	Flac
		Can we get flacplayer.java to play things that we need jflac for:
			Adrian Orange
			A Perfect Circle - Mer de noms
			Pink Floyd - Pulse (disc 1)

		Always use LucidaGrande font?
		
	Tray icon
		Gnome 3 doesn't support. Code works but creates a bad entry on taskbar.
		What systems do support? 
		What other systems don't support? How to handle?

Future Features, maybe:
	Tag Window, next and previous button
	
	Dark Stylesheet 
	
	
Note
	You can increase the slider button size by increasing the font size.
