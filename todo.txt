If you load albumsAndTracks but not sources Hypnos acts real wierd. Goes back and forth between not responding. On Windows confirmed. 
	Does not happen on linux, but still, this is a wierd state -- library without sources. 
	
	Maria had it crash her computer in the following use case:
		1. Install new version
		2. Move music folder from E: to F:
		3. notice nothing's in the library
		4. Add F:\music (without removing E:\music)
		5. Hard crash
		
	LastFm - If someone loves a track, update love indicator immediately, and switch it back if failure. don't wait for success to update UI
	
	Windows - EXE Wrapper doesn't behave well with pinning.  Try changing icon in javaw.exe		
	

After Beta 3
	look at settings as they are written out, some issues
		X & Y Position: Sometimes it doesn't report correctly
		Window size: it always shows the actual window size. Do we want to write out the cached windowed mode sizes if maximized? 
	
	Windows -> Open with causes the name not to appear.
			
	Windows 
		Send a file via command line when hypnos isn't playing -- it starts
		Then do it again with hypnos playing, it doesn't start playing the new track, just puts it on curernt list	
	
	Drag and Drop to Playlist Info update current list if it is that playlist unchanged
	
	Windows - First hover over the love button makes it shift positions
		Launch Hypnos without lastfm widgets showing
		turn on last fm widgets
		hover over love button -- it shifts
		If you launch with lastfm showing, doesn't happen
	
	Improve library checker
		Log / status
		some controls, maybe
		use the diskTimeStamp variables I added
		
	AppImage - Combine the two scripts that are currently being used to launch hypnos and make them one
		
	Last.fm		
		Hotkeys?
			use keypad+ and keypad-		
				
		Fancy stuff:
			Heart column on current list
			Update full library by looking at user.getLovedTracks
			dynamically update lastfm context menu based on love state
		
	Allow multiple values for global hotkeys?
	
	Multi monitor positioning doesn't seem to work right all the time
	
	Sometimes the track title disappears while playing

	File name in tag window somewhere
		I tried doing what I have on the album track list window. It looked ugly and cluttered. 

	KDE Neon
		Can't drag ad drop an mp3 into hypnos
			onDragOver doesn't seem to hear the drag event. 
		
		User said it opened the track instead of opening folder. Confirmed on KDE Neon image on my computer, it opened gwenview 
			https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48131760/desktop-getdesktop-open-folder-in-kde-opens-up-gwenview-instead-of-dolphin
			
	I emptied the current list and library and playing track, and the art stayed. probably good to get rid of that
	
	Add a place to drag and drop folders (or navigate to them) to demand that they be rescanned immediately.

	Search for artist / album image data possibilities online, show in a window, let user choose. 
		
	Refactor Library
		Make a source directory a class, not just a path.
			Library Source Directories - highlight in red if they are missing. 

		An album will form from tracks if you edit them and they aren't currently an album. But an album won't split if you edit tags and make it not be an album.
			Is this desired behavior? I feel like probably no -- it can create different states based on the same disk contents, which doesn't make sense
					
		Sometimes there are duplicated tracks in the track list
		
		When removing all sources, it takes a long time to remove everything (5+ seconds)
			This is because of the processWatcherEvents function taking lots of time on load. 
			
		Setup a currentList.updateAlbum and updatePlaylist system
			Doesn't change artwork
			CurrentplayingTrack is the same one
			updates data and locations
			
		Library load and unload time
		
		Loader status % complete thing
		
		Allow sources to be hidden
		
		Maybe allow a filter for file type and lossy vs not lossy
			Maybe just a special search text "type:mp3", "type:lossy"
			I dunno making search box script is alot. 
		
		Give user feedback about the disk scanner and the abiliyt to control it	

			
	Drag and drop from misc places to system
		playlist table -> m3u
		track table, history, queue, info windows, current table -> single tracks
		album table -> folder
		
	Windows 7 - Songs with strange characters display as noise -- Neon Genesis Evangelion

	Missing tracks are deleted from currentlist after restart if CurrentList.mode == ALBUM instead of remaining and being highlighted in red

	Redo global hotkeys, do it on a system-by-system type basis.
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79658/react-on-global-hotkey-in-a-java-program-on-windows-linux-mac
		Some Global Hotkeys aren't consumed - Win + C, Win + X, etc.  
			
		Windows:
			jkeymaster - windows + x keys not supported
			
			JHotKeys - I can't find a jar, and having trouble building one. 
		
			JNativeHook: Hotkey consumption for win keys is bad -- if you press win + v it works, but if you release the win button first, stuff breaks badly 
				
		Linux
			http://sourceforge.net/projects/jxgrabkey/
			
			JNativeHook - No consumption of hotkey
	
	Tag auto fix button

	Bug report dialog
		
	Maybe add sorting of roman numerals? 
		https://gist.github.com/julienhaversano/9197588
	
	Show in tag edit window when a file doesn't support a particular tag type
	
	If something gets dropped into config/playlists, update the UI to include it? 
	
	Playlist throttled filter, but man, who's going to have over 1000 playlists? 
	
	Add email link to bug link in about tab

	Memory Hog issue	
		With an empty library and no current list and nothing loaded uses about 175mb on Windows 7.
			Clicking around the UI and using every UI feature except for loading library or tracks can climb it to about 300mb
			loading a folder of 58 albums climbs the usage to ~400mb. Removing seems to push it to 411mb
			loading a folder of 2460 albums climbs to the usage to 1.7GB
			closing and reopening 
			closing and reopening:
				drives it up to 1.4gb + (i'm sure it would keep going for a while longer)
				with library loader and library updater disabled puts the memory at 320mb
				with updater disabled puts the memory at 1.2+ (probably would've kept climbing)
				with loader disabled it stops at ~367mb. 
			
			SO loader is a source of memory consumption definitely. 
				-Xmx600m fixed this on windows 7. Kept it floating around 450mb. 
			
		loading images definitely makes it real bad. Fixing that will help, but won't solve it. 
		
		scrolling up and down the album or track table table does increase memory usage, but "only" by 100-200mb. 
		
		Start Hypnos
		Load a big library ( /d/music)
		Let it finish loading
		Close and reopen hypnos
		1.6GB memory footprint
		
		Start Hypnos
		Load a big library (/d/music)
		during load -- 1.26GB
		after load - 721MB
		after restart hypnos - 1.5GB
		it seems to stay there. I let it run for about 10 minutes, no drop in memory usage. 
		
		stopping the libraryUpdater and libraryLoader seems to cut into the problem tremendously
		
		Even after stopping updater and loader, it creeps up. It looks like everytime a new song is played?
			confirmed. Each new song spikes the memory. Just flipping through the songs without playing them causes it
				Is this related to the skipping issue? - doesn't seem to be with one or two tracks after ramping up the memory
			Was able to get it to 3 GB just by flipping through tracks. Could probably go higher. 
		
		flipping through tracks quickly by hitting next button also causes memory spike. Not terrible. 
				
		2017/12/25 - I was able to temper this problem significantly by having only one image loader thread and by setting -Xmx

   Scroll speed on lyrics scroll pane when the lyrics almost-but-dont-quite fit one full screen is really slow. 
   
   Don't allow tag table columns to be reordered
   
	Try to fit all data in current list table by adjusting columns that aren't no-resize on setCurrentList, if not possible, do nothing
		I did some work on this. It conflicts with our FormattedAlbumCell because there, to keep it from wrapping
		we setminwidth to double.max, causing the fit function to fail. 
		I used the reflection stuff from this thread, and I think it would've worked if not for this issue:
			https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23284437/javafx-tablecolumn-resize-to-fit-cell-content
		Of course, I would have to then check table width, fail gracefully and revert, or distribute excess space. 
		
	Add a ton of albums to the current list. (close and reopen hypnos?) Ctrl + A, delete. Exception. UI is broken

	Resize Policy
		Windowed mode, shrink window until a scrollbar appears. Maximize window so scrollbar disappears -- Scrollbar width is still accounted for
		
		Scrollbar width is calculated wrong by 4 pixels. I have it hardcoded, but I posted a SE question

	Tray Icon
		I have a few demos that are all terrible. It looks like we need to wait for JavaFX to get this going for us. 
		Or maybe just show an icon with no menus. Kinda hate that. How do we exit?

:::: Refactor / organize my code ::::

 	Make LibraryUpdater part of Library. Is there a way to abstract out the Platform -> RunLater part? I feel like we're just stuck w/ that, which kind of ties to us JavaFX. 
 		Maybe ui.runMe ( Runnable ), and then the UI can decide whether to launch a new thread, have a thread idling, do it on this thread, or use something like Platform.runLater()	
		
	a better structure for hotkey commands (maybe combine with commandline commands?)

	Playback Problems
		Ogg - In general OGG playback is garbage. 
			seeking is done using read() instead of skip(), so it's slow.
			three-silver.ogg takes a long time to load and stop. Not sure about seek.
