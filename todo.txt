Get from VLC backend to something more lightweight
   Windows stutters at beginning of each track

Drag and Drop to Playlist Info update current list if it is that playlist unchanged

JavaFX / Linux Open File Dialog causes crash

Linux: Right click on table headers causes resort

Improve memory usage if possible, particularly look at library i think that's a big cause

Maybe get rid of log output when calling it at the commandline with switches to control current version
   try hypnos --next and see output, I don't love it
   
Remove WinXP not supported by Jfx

Gnome - title on taskbar is set as net.joshuad.hypnos.Hypnos

Gnome - See how sys tray interacts w/ topiconsplus extension

Add a place to drag and drop folders (or navigate to them) to demand that they be rescanned immediately.
   Maybe add a right click > rescan button on library window

Sometimes it doesn't make sound after restarting into the paused state.  

Build jxgrabhotkey as a seperate jar
   
Look at getting completely off swing, we can shave a lot out of the jres if we do

windows button sizes are sometimes off a bit

"show only non-album tracks" checkbox isn't centered right
   
Sometimes the art pane can become non-responsive. I dragged and dropped an image from google and it stopped changing
   I've seen it a few other times too.
   It happened as i was scrolling quickly though Josh radio, around Joanna newsom

Can we use Java's Jigsaw to reduce distribution size somehow? We had issues w/ circular dependencies, but can we work
through that?

There's a significant delay after close is hit until hypnos window closes

improve library scanner
   Accidental Sebiards - Live at the watermark
   The Smiths - Louder than Bombs
   Onymous - Untitled
   Mahler - 4th Symphony

   Don't add an artist that has no name, just those tracks don't get grouped into an artist

   An album will form from tracks if you edit them and they aren't currently an album. But an album won't split if you edit tags and make it not be an album.
      Is this desired behavior? I feel like probably no -- it can create different states based on the same disk contents, which doesn't make sense

Windows System Integration
      Select Multiple Files in explorer - No Option to play in Hypnos. Add that
      "Open with" causes the current track button to not show the current track's name.
      Commandline Interface
         Send a file via command line when hypnos isn't playing -- it starts
         Then do it again with hypnos playing, it doesn't start playing the new track, just puts it on current list

If something gets dropped into config/playlists folders, update the UI to include it?

Linux: Dynamic menu titles in system tray
   This is kind of a pain because of the icons and because I'm bad at C



Windows - Trailing Spaces in File Name
      Right now it panics and restarts scan. Just keep going, ignore the problem, log it.

   Linux: Media Buttons
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53550397/javafx-keyevent-is-it-possible-to-get-more-info-for-undefined-events

   column widths don't resize right when you change the window size right as the program starts
      Confirmed with configuration Cols A B C D, with B C D being no-resize via hypnosresizepolicy

   Windows: Move to next monitor with ultramon and minimize to system tray dont play well together
      User can just disable minimize to system tray and still close to system tray, so whatever nbd

	Mounted Audio CDs

   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51851572/java-fx-button-is-staying-pressed-after-drag-event

	Can I expand encoding information display using vlc?

	Windows - First hover over the love button makes it shift positions
		Launch Hypnos without lastfm widgets showing
		turn on last fm widgets
		hover over love button -- it shifts
		If you launch with lastfm showing, doesn't happen

	KDE Neon
		Can't drag ad drop an mp3 into hypnos
			onDragOver doesn't seem to hear the drag event.

		User said it opened the track instead of opening folder. Confirmed on KDE Neon image on my computer, it opened gwenview

	Drag and drop from misc places to system
		playlist table -> m3u
		track table, history, queue, info windows, current table -> copy single tracks

	Tag auto fix button

	Maybe add sorting of roman numerals?
		https://gist.github.com/julienhaversano/9197588

	Playlist throttled filter, but who's going to have over 1000 playlists?

	Maybe allow a filter for file type and lossy vs not lossy
		Maybe just a special search text "type:mp3", "type:lossy"
		I dunno making search box script is alot.
		
	Windows
		NSIS
			Version number dynamically assigned

			Open-with shell integration

				This is pretty close. It makes an entry but it doesn't work. Could be a lot of different problems.
				WriteRegStr HKCR ".flac\shell\Hypnos\command" "" "$INSTDIR\Hypnos.exe $\"%1$\""

		When you launch show busy mouse cursor

:::: Refactor / organize my code ::::

	a better structure for hotkey commands (maybe combine with commandline commands?)

	Refactor Library
		Make LibraryUpdater part of Library. 

		Setup a currentList.updateAlbum and updatePlaylist system
			Doesn't change artwork
			CurrentplayingTrack is the same one
			updates data and locations
