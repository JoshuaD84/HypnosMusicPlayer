Show in tag edit window when a file doesn't support a particular tag type	

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51851572/java-fx-button-is-staying-pressed-after-drag-event

Drag and Drop to Playlist Info update current list if it is that playlist unchanged

File name in tag window somewhere
	I tried doing what I have on the album track list window. It looked ugly and cluttered.

Features that need System-by-System attention

	Mounted Audio CDs
		Linux
         Linux auto converts them to wavs, but I can't drag directly from the disc. Need to copy waves to local file
         system

		Windows - Does not work

	System Integration
		Windows
			Select Multiple Files in explorer - No Option to play in Hypnos. Add that
			"Open with" causes the current track button to not show the current track's name.
			Commandline Interface
				Send a file via command line when hypnos isn't playing -- it starts
				Then do it again with hypnos playing, it doesn't start playing the new track, just puts it on current list

::::::::::::::

Future
   Sometimes the art pane can become non-responsive. I dragged and dropped an image from google and it stopped changing
      I've seen it a few other times too.

	Can I expand encoding information display using vlc?
      mediaPlayer.getMedia*

	Windows - First hover over the love button makes it shift positions
		Launch Hypnos without lastfm widgets showing
		turn on last fm widgets
		hover over love button -- it shifts
		If you launch with lastfm showing, doesn't happen

	KDE Neon
		Can't drag ad drop an mp3 into hypnos
			onDragOver doesn't seem to hear the drag event.

		User said it opened the track instead of opening folder. Confirmed on KDE Neon image on my computer, it opened gwenview

	Add a place to drag and drop folders (or navigate to them) to demand that they be rescanned immediately.
		Maybe add a right click > rescan button on library window

	Drag and drop from misc places to system
		playlist table -> m3u
		track table, history, queue, info windows, current table -> copy single tracks

	Tag auto fix button

	Maybe add sorting of roman numerals?
		https://gist.github.com/julienhaversano/9197588

	If something gets dropped into config/playlists folders, update the UI to include it?

	Playlist throttled filter, but who's going to have over 1000 playlists?

	Maybe allow a filter for file type and lossy vs not lossy
		Maybe just a special search text "type:mp3", "type:lossy"
		I dunno making search box script is alot.
		
	Windows
		NSIS
			Version number dynamically assigned

			Open-with shell integration
				http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Add_your_app_in_each_EXE_in_the_context_menu

				This is pretty close. It makes an entry but it doesn't work. Could be a lot of different problems.
				WriteRegStr HKCR ".flac\shell\Hypnos\command" "" "$INSTDIR\Hypnos.exe $\"%1$\""

		When you launch show busy mouse cursor

:::: Refactor / organize my code ::::

	a better structure for hotkey commands (maybe combine with commandline commands?)

	Refactor Library
		Make LibraryUpdater part of Library. Is there a way to abstract out the Platform -> RunLater part? I feel like we're just stuck w/ that, which kind of ties to us JavaFX
 			Maybe ui.runMe ( Runnable ), and then the UI can decide whether to launch a new thread, have a thread idling, do it on this thread, or use something like Platform.runLater()
	
		An album will form from tracks if you edit them and they aren't currently an album. But an album won't split if you edit tags and make it not be an album.
			Is this desired behavior? I feel like probably no -- it can create different states based on the same disk contents, which doesn't make sense

		Sometimes there are duplicated tracks in the track list

		Setup a currentList.updateAlbum and updatePlaylist system
			Doesn't change artwork
			CurrentplayingTrack is the same one
			updates data and locations

		Library load and unload time
