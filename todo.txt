Hotkeys
	windows intellitype work
	Can we get hotkeys for wierd buttons on linux?

	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/858766/generate-manifest-class-path-from-classpath-in-ant

System Tray
	Windows
		Implement
		Testing	

Sync the jvm arguments in my various launch scripts, including within eclipse

Features that need System-by-System attention

	Mounted Audio CDs
		Linux
         Linux auto converts them to wavs, but I can't drag directly from the disc. Need to copy waves to local file
         system

		Windows
			Does not work

	Executable Wrapping
		Linux - I'm happy with appimages
			Need to reduce size of appimage by testing on various systems and getting rid of unnecessary libraries

		Windows
			EXE Wrapper doesn't behave well with pinning.  Try changing icon in javaw.exe
			https://www.howtogeek.com/75983/stupid-geek-tricks-how-to-modify-the-icon-of-an-.exe-file/

	System Integration
		Linux - Seems good

		Windows
			Select Multiple Files in explorer - No Option to play in Hypnos. Add that
			"Open with" causes the current track button to not show the current track's name.
			Commandline Interface
				Send a file via command line when hypnos isn't playing -- it starts
				Then do it again with hypnos playing, it doesn't start playing the new track, just puts it on current list


Future
   Sometimes the art pane can become non-responsive. I dragged and dropped an image frm google and it stopped changing
      I've seen it a few other times too.

   Support for other scrobbling services. Dropdown box in the lastfm tab. Rename it "Scrobbling" or something

   Maybe an artist tab on media library?

   Maybe change lyric window content on select track

	Can I expand encoding information display using vlc?
      mediaPlayer.getMedia*

	All
		Right click menu settings for playlists -- shuffle, repeat, etc.

			RadioMenuItem noChange = new RadioMenuItem ( "None" );
			RadioMenuItem sequential = new RadioMenuItem ( "Sequential" );
			RadioMenuItem shuffle = new RadioMenuItem ( "Shuffle" );

			ToggleGroup shuffleGroup = new ToggleGroup();
			noChange.setToggleGroup( shuffleGroup );
			sequential.setToggleGroup( shuffleGroup );
			shuffle.setToggleGroup( shuffleGroup );

			Menu shuffleMode = new Menu ( "Shuffle Mode" );
			shuffleMode.getItems().addAll( noChange, sequential, shuffle );

		Show in tag edit window when a file doesn't support a particular tag type

		Make a collection of test files.

	Drag and Drop to Playlist Info update current list if it is that playlist unchanged

	Windows - First hover over the love button makes it shift positions
		Launch Hypnos without lastfm widgets showing
		turn on last fm widgets
		hover over love button -- it shifts
		If you launch with lastfm showing, doesn't happen

	Improve library checker
		Log / status
		some controls, maybe
		use the diskTimeStamp variables I added

	File name in tag window somewhere
		I tried doing what I have on the album track list window. It looked ugly and cluttered.

	KDE Neon
		Can't drag ad drop an mp3 into hypnos
			onDragOver doesn't seem to hear the drag event.

		User said it opened the track instead of opening folder. Confirmed on KDE Neon image on my computer, it opened gwenview
			https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48131760/desktop-getdesktop-open-folder-in-kde-opens-up-gwenview-instead-of-dolphin

	Add a place to drag and drop folders (or navigate to them) to demand that they be rescanned immediately.
		Maybe add a right click > rescan button on library window

	Drag and drop from misc places to system
		playlist table -> m3u
		track table, history, queue, info windows, current table -> copy single tracks

	Tag auto fix button

	Maybe add sorting of roman numerals?
		https://gist.github.com/julienhaversano/9197588

	If something gets dropped into config/playlists folders, update the UI to include it?

	Playlist throttled filter, but who's going to have over 1000 playlists?


:::: Java / JavaFX stuff ::::
	Scroll speed on lyrics scroll pane when the lyrics almost-but-dont-quite fit one full screen is really slow.

	Try to fit all data in current list table by adjusting columns that aren't no-resize on setCurrentList, if not possible, do nothing
		I did some work on this. It conflicts with our FormattedAlbumCell because there, to keep it from wrapping
		we setminwidth to double.max, causing the fit function to fail.
		I used the reflection stuff from this thread, and I think it would've worked if not for this issue:
			https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23284437/javafx-tablecolumn-resize-to-fit-cell-content
		Of course, I would have to then check table width, fail gracefully and revert, or distribute excess space.

	Resize Policy
		Windowed mode, shrink window until a scrollbar appears. Maximize window so scrollbar disappears -- Scrollbar width is still accounted for

		Scrollbar width is calculated wrong by 4 pixels. I have it hardcoded, but I posted a SE question
			https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47852175/get-full-width-of-scrollbar-for-a-tableview

	Double clicking on table-column dividers doesn't call resize:
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47852239/customresizepolicy-not-triggering-when-a-columns-headers-divider-is-double-cli
		not fixed in java 11 / javafx11

	Tray Icon
		I have a few demos that are all terrible. It looks like we need to wait for JavaFX to get this going for us.
		Or maybe just show an icon with no menus. Kinda hate that. How do we exit?
		Gnome 3 doesn't support. Code works but creates a bad entry on taskbar.
		What systems do support?
		What other systems don't support? How to handle?

	Tiny drop shadow on transport buttons when in dark theme. It's the line HBox, VBox, #transport { ... -fx-background-color: #222222 ... }

	Showing any dialog prevents window drag resize in ubuntu / other linux

		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33134791/javafx-stage-cant-be-resized-after-showing-a-dialog
		Not fixed in java 11 / javafx11

	While loading the library, the table view scrolls a little bit.
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47950917/stop-tableview-small-scroll-when-adding-content-to-bottom-of-table
		1/2/18 - Bug submitted to bugs.java.com
		not fixed in java 11 / javafx11

	Inconsistent KeyEvent consumption - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48054928/inconsistent-keyevent-consumption-by-textfield
		Resolved in java 9 apparently

:::: Refactor / organize my code ::::
 	Make LibraryUpdater part of Library. Is there a way to abstract out the Platform -> RunLater part? I feel like we're just stuck w/ that, which kind of ties to us JavaFX

 		Maybe ui.runMe ( Runnable ), and then the UI can decide whether to launch a new thread, have a thread idling, do it on this thread, or use something like Platform.runLater()

	a better structure for hotkey commands (maybe combine with commandline commands?)


	Refactor Library

		An album will form from tracks if you edit them and they aren't currently an album. But an album won't split if you edit tags and make it not be an album.
			Is this desired behavior? I feel like probably no -- it can create different states based on the same disk contents, which doesn't make sense

		Sometimes there are duplicated tracks in the track list

		When removing all sources, it takes a long time to remove everything (5+ seconds)
			This is because of the processWatcherEvents function taking lots of time on load.

		Setup a currentList.updateAlbum and updatePlaylist system
			Doesn't change artwork
			CurrentplayingTrack is the same one
			updates data and locations

		Library load and unload time

		Maybe allow a filter for file type and lossy vs not lossy
			Maybe just a special search text "type:mp3", "type:lossy"
			I dunno making search box script is alot.
