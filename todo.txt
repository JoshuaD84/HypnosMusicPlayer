	Hot Keys
		
	Error notifications	
		Have there be an in-program way to view error log? Or at least, view it using the system text editor. 

	Some way to get the file name corresponding to a file in the current list. 
		Use album info window or something like it? 
	
	Current List Info
		Show total length of currentlist somewhere.  
		Maybe show current playing track info, like bitrate, etc. This would probably go in a status bar at the bottom. 

	When you click on an album on the list, show it in the art pane for a little bit? 
	
Bug Fixes / Incremental Improvements	
	Changing tag information doesn't update all the proper places.
		Changing disc info on album list
		changing album info when the album is loaded in current list. 
	
	Look at queue right click functionaliy
		After playing a track, should we remove it from the queue? 
	
	Make sure horizontal scroll bars never appear
		6/9 - Can't find anything on google.

	Remember windowed-width even if maximized

	Editing multiple album artists doesn't seem to work - Dusty Fingers
	
	Make sure the text labels for time left and time elapsed are padded to NN:NN:NN, to avoid stuff moving. 
	
	Guarantee that only one track at a time has the play indicator. 

Refactor / organize my code. 
 	Separate player / ui systems. 
 	Use start() exclusively, get rid of all calls in main()
 	Have a single thread handle playing all tracks. 
 		Have it be the same thread that accepts requests rather than spawning new threads off UI actions. 
 	Clean up start() and MusicPlayerUI
 	Maybe get rid of static classes.

		buffered input stream on the random access File stream
		
	Ogg
		Works, seeking is done using read() instead of skip(), so it's a little slow.
		
	m4b - Fast play for some reason
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44750751/why-are-m4bs-playing-at-faster-speeds
		I need to set the sample rate to one of these: 96000, 88200, 64000, 48000, 44100, 32000, 24000, 22050, 16000, 12000, 11025, 8000, 7350 
		The files seem te report the wrong sample rate. JAAD acutally reads them. 
		
	Flac
		Can we get flacplayer.java to play things that we need jflac for:
			Adrian Orange
			A Perfect Circle - Mer de noms
			Pink Floyd - Pulse (disc 1)
