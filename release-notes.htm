   <h1>Hypnos - Beta 6 Release Notes</h1>
   <p><a target="_blank" href="http://hypnosplayer.org">Released: 2019-07-14</a></p>
   <p>Hypnos Beta 6 is done.  I have made some nice improvements, and I still have some work to do before version 1.</p>
   <h2>New Features</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>Library scaner log</li>
      <li>Improved Tag Editor Interface</li>
      <li>Search web button on lyrics window</li>
      <li>Tag edits are now immediately displayed in library and current list</li>
      <li>Reduced memory footprint.  ~50% on Windows and ~30% on GNU/Linux.</li>
      <li>New Library Scanner - Scan about twice as fast, no more corner case bugs</li>
      <li>Ctrl+Click on current track to go to album</li>
      <li>Improved filename parsing for artist name info when tags aren't present</li>
      <li>Scanner status bar also shows removal progress</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Bugs Fixed</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>Prevent the art pane from getting stuck on particular artwork</li>
      <li>Remove unncessary printlines when communicating with Hypnos via commandline interface</li>
      <li>Windows: fix centering on 'non-album-tracks-only' checkbox</li>
      <li>Fix bug where tracks are added incorrectly to filtered current list</li>
      <li>Reset to default view: sort order is now properly set</li>
      <li>Prevent right clicks from changing selected library view</li>
      <li>Ctrl+F now searches in selected pane as intended</li>
      <li>Prevent crashes when filtering lists during load</li>
      <li>Immediate failure when trying to run on Windows XP since it is not supported</li>
      <li>Windows: Fix button sizes</li>
      <li>Window icon on lyrics window</li>
      <li>Fix Lyrics search so it works again</li>
      <li>Improve table scrolling during load. It's not perfect, but now it's much less disruptive</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Known Bugs</h2>
   <p>If you run into any bugs that aren't listed here, please <a href="https://github.com/JoshuaD84/HypnosMusicPlayer" target="_blank">report them</a>, so I can fix them!</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Ubuntu 16.04, Fedora 27.1.6, and other version of linux - Opening system file location dialog sometimes crashes the program.  Please use drag and drop and avoid native file search windows for now. I'm working on a solution. </li>
      <li>Linux: If it's paused in the middle of the track after the program starts, it may not make sound. Need to start playing a new track to get sound.</li>
      <li>Linux: Right click on table headers causes re-sort</li>
      <li>Windows: If you use ultramon and the "move to next monitor" hotkey along with Hypnos's "minimize to system tray" option, if Hypnos is maximized it will disappear to tray icon when you activate the ultramon hotkey. Disable "minimize to system tray" to address this for now. Looking for a better solution.</li>
      <li>Linux/Gnome 3: Title on task bar is net.joshuad.hypnos.Hypnos instead of just Hypnos</li>
      <li>Audio playback still isn't as good as I'd like for it to be.</li>
      <li>Linux/KDE Neon - Drag and drop from OS to Hypnos doesn't work well.  Browse button does not work properly.</li>
      <li>Linux - If you open a native file search window, you cannot drag-resize hypnos. Can still maximize/restore</li>
      <li>Double clicking on table header dividers has some minor bugs</li>
      <li>There may be seek bar issues on some ACC files</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Goals for Future Releases</h2>
   <p>The big pending project is a rewrite of the audio player engine. VLC was a big improvement on my previous system, but it's large
   and still doesn't behave well enough, especially on windows.  In the next few releases I will be focusing on
   replacing the audioplayer engine on each operating system with native decoders.</p>
   <p>The "Artist" view is still a second class citizen in the backend. You may notice this occasionally as the library
   loads. I would like to improve the backend for this view and change it from a list to a treeview that is
   expandable, with albums and tracks nested under Artist names. I'd also like to get a bit more aggressive about trying
   to find tracks by the artist in things like soundtracks or "featured" on songs.</p>
   <p>I would like to add a File view, next to Artists, Albums, Tracks, and Playlists. The File view would ignore tags
   and just be a reflection of the disk. I started work on this, but the JavaFX TreeView class was kinda clunky so I
   decided to release now and work on this in the next release.</p>
   <p>I'd also like to work on system integration. There are a handful of bugs on each of the target platforms / desktop
   environments. This is relatively tedious work, but I'm hoping to make a few fixes here each release.  I'd also like
   to package Hypnos targeting Ubuntu as a .deb file, which would significantly reduce the download size. Improved drag
   and drop <em>from</em> Hypnos to the desktop environment would also be nice</p>
   <p>I'd like to work on reducing the download size and the memory footprint while running.</p>
   <p>I'd probably like to add a few more color themes, and maybe allow the user to set the themes. They're simple CSS,
   so it's not too hard for users to create their own.</p>

<h1>Hypnos - Beta 4 Release Notes</h1>
<p>Released: 2018-11-09</p>
<p>Hypnos beta 4 is released. I believe this will be the last beta, the next release should be version 1.</p>

<p>I'm pretty happy with this release. The big change here is in the backend -- we are now using VLC's libraries to
decode our audio. Java doesn't have great audio decoding support and the previous decoders were hodged together from
various places and had some known issues. Outsourcing this set of problems to VLC lets me focus on the user experience
and UI design, which is where I want to be focused. The only downside to this approach is that I have to bundle VLC's
libraries, so the download got even larger. I hope to be able to shave it down with a future release. For now, I
apologize to any users that are on a slow internet connection.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Hypnos Beta 4 will not load your old library data, and will instead do a single rescan of your entire
library.</strong> Playlists and settings will not be lost. It just has to rescan your library to pickup some additional
metadata we are using.</p>

<h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Audio decoding via VLC, which means a lot more file support and less buggy decoding</li>
   <li>Allow album list to be sorted by file date -- so you can sort by the newest albums in your library</li>
   <li>Drag and drop from current playing song title</li>
   <li>Escape clears focus on library search boxes.</li>
   <li>Scroll wheel over volume slider changes volume</li>
   <li>Progress indicator for 'Export as Folder' option</li>
   <li>Truncate year column to 4 digits</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bugs Fixed</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Windows - Popup windows have proper font size</li>
   <li>Linux - Volume slider now works on all file types</li>
   <li>Add dark theme styling to export popup</li>
   <li>Don't freeze UI when exporting playlist as folder</li>
   <li>Crop was misbehaving, repaired.</li>
   <li>Update playlist pane properly when editing playlists that already exist</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Ubuntu 16.04, Fedora 27.1.6 - Opening system file location dialog sometimes crashes the virtual machine</li>
   <li>Release is very large due to bundled libraries (VLC & Java). I hope to have it trimmed down significantly for
   future releases.</li>
   <li>32-bit linux version not released. I don't think anyone is using it, and it's alot more work to curate the
   necessary libraries, test on 32-bit machines, make the builds, etc.  If there's an actual demand I could look at
   bringing this back down the road, but I just don't think there are very many 32-bit desktop linux users still out
   there.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bugfixes</h2>

	<li>Tag window resizes content properly</li>
	<li>Solve the "playback lock" bug</li>
	<li>Current List Playing indicator always works nowk, stop always removes it. </li>
	<li>Fix volume / unmute bug</li>

</ul>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>OSX not supported for the time being.</strong>  I don't have an OSX development / testing machine, and seeing all of the small bugs I had to fix in windows made me convinced that it's not responsible to write software for an OS that I can't test on myself.  I'd like to work on an OSX version and I bet it wouldn't be too hard to get hypnos running well there, but I need regular access to the platform to do that.</li>
	<li>Decoding for non-flac files is still pretty spotty. Going to be rewriting all decoders at some point.</li>
	<li>Column order, width, and sort preferences are not saved from session to session</li>
	<li>Memory and CPU usage is still higher than it needs to be. Rewriting the library loader should fix this</li>
	<li>Global hotkeys on windows are a little finicky. On linux they aren't consumed.</li>
	<li>Double clicking a columns header divider to shrink wrap column content breaks the 100% width rule, any small resize repairs</li>
	<li>Linux Only - After a dialog appears, main window cannot be drag-resized. Known javafx bug, still looking for workaround</li>
   <li>Windows 7 or earlier - Unicode characters don't display correctly.</li>
	<li>I don't think an album falsely ID'd as an album can be made un-albumed unless you edit the tags and then reload library</li>
</ul>
<br />
