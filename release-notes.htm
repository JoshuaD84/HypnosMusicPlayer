</ul>
	
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>OSX not supported for the time being.</strong>  I don't have an OSX development / testing machine, and seeing all of the small bugs I had to fix in windows made me convinced that it's not responsible to write software for an OS that I can't test on myself.  I'd like to work on an OSX version and I bet it wouldn't be too hard to get hypnos running well there, but I need regular access to the platform to do that.</li>
	<li>Decoding for non-flac files is still pretty spotty. Going to be rewriting all decoders at some point.</li>
	<li>Column order, width, and sort preferences are not saved from session to session</li>
	<li>Memory and CPU usage is still higher than it needs to be. Rewriting the library loader should fix this</li>
	<li>Global hotkeys on windows are a little finicky. On linux they aren't consumed.</li>
	<li>Double clicking a columns header divider to shrink wrap column content breaks the 100% width rule, any small resize repairs</li>
	<li>Linux Only - After a dialog appears, main window cannot be drag-resized. Known javafx bug, still looking for workaround</li>
   <li>Windows 7 or earlier - Unicode characters don't display correctly.</li>
	<li>I don't think an album falsely ID'd as an album can be made un-albumed unless you edit the tags and then reload library</li>
</ul>
