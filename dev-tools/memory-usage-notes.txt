	Memory Hog issue	
		With an empty library and no current list and nothing loaded uses about 175mb on Windows 7.
			Clicking around the UI and using every UI feature except for loading library or tracks can climb it to about 300mb
			loading a folder of 58 albums climbs the usage to ~400mb. Removing seems to push it to 411mb
			loading a folder of 2460 albums climbs to the usage to 1.7GB
			closing and reopening 
			closing and reopening:
				drives it up to 1.4gb + (i'm sure it would keep going for a while longer)
				with library loader and library updater disabled puts the memory at 320mb
				with updater disabled puts the memory at 1.2+ (probably would've kept climbing)
				with loader disabled it stops at ~367mb. 
			
			SO loader is a source of memory consumption definitely. 
				-Xmx600m fixed this on windows 7. Kept it floating around 450mb. 
			
		loading images definitely makes it real bad. Fixing that will help, but won't solve it. 
		
		scrolling up and down the album or track table table does increase memory usage, but "only" by 100-200mb. 
		
		Start Hypnos
		Load a big library ( /d/music)
		Let it finish loading
		Close and reopen hypnos
		1.6GB memory footprint
		
		Start Hypnos
		Load a big library (/d/music)
		during load -- 1.26GB
		after load - 721MB
		after restart hypnos - 1.5GB
		it seems to stay there. I let it run for about 10 minutes, no drop in memory usage. 
		
		stopping the libraryUpdater and libraryLoader seems to cut into the problem tremendously
		
		Even after stopping updater and loader, it creeps up. It looks like everytime a new song is played?
			confirmed. Each new song spikes the memory. Just flipping through the songs without playing them causes it
				Is this related to the skipping issue? - doesn't seem to be with one or two tracks after ramping up the memory
			Was able to get it to 3 GB just by flipping through tracks. Could probably go higher. 
		
		flipping through tracks quickly by hitting next button also causes memory spike. Not terrible. 
				
		2017/12/25 - I was able to temper this problem significantly by having only one image loader thread and by setting -Xmx
		
			Windows - Volume takes a split second to change.

	
	Get java to release memory back sometimes. We use a lot on load

		-XX:GCTimeRatio=19 -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=20- XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=30
			Doesn't work on my system. It seems to keep the memory it grabs. 
			Added a folder to library, let it load, then removed it. Memory jumped from 250mb to 850mb
